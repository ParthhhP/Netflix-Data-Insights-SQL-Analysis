# Netflix-Data-Insights-SQL-Analysis

In order to gain important insights into user viewing patterns, content trends, and genre popularity, this project will use SQL to analyze Netflix data. The study will investigate how audience preferences are influenced by material type, release year, and genre by querying a dataset that contains details on Netflix's vast collection, viewer ratings, and content categories.

Important goals consist of:

- determining the most well-liked titles and categories by looking at user ratings and participation.
- examining patterns in the release of content across time and how they affect viewership.
- By contrasting geographical preferences and binge-watching tendencies, one might gain insight into user behavior.
- extracting and visualizing data insights using SQL queries, which lays the groundwork for more thorough research and business suggestions for audience targeting and content curation.

# Database and Tools used
The main tools for developing and managing the Netflix dataset, running SQL queries, and carrying out the analysis in this project will be pgAdmin 4 and PostgreSQL.
